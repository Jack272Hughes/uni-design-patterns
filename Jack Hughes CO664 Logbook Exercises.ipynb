    "This implementation does not use the traditional approach to MVC which normally would allow the view and model to commicate with each other. In instead has all events, UI handling methods and variable values go through the controller which will then pass it to the correct component.\n",
    "I believe this to be a more reusable approach since by removing the coupling between the model and view, it allows you to swap their implementations to adhere to different operating systems or different UI layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the MVC design pattern is that it allows you to separate the logic of your UI from the data. This separation of concern makes it more testable, reusable, and readable. As mentioned above it also allows you to add modifications or completely new implementation (potentially with other libraries/frameworks) without affecting the entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does come with some disadvantages though. Firstly, in large projects this separation can increase the overall size of the project as you create more files to adhere to the three-part structure, although not as noticable in a small product, this can slow down any attempt to find specific functionality in the code or being able to understand the flow of data when debugging. Furthermore, even though the separation allows you swap out implementations, these new files would usually still need to comply with a specific contract. For example, even though they're decoupled, if you have a really complicated model that the view uses to render a page, you can't just replace this model with one that contains less information, otherwise errors will be thrown by the controller when the view requests data that the model no longer has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think the MVC design pattern can be very beneficial to a project since it gives programmers more freedom on the technologies they can use and, with a good project structure, you can avoid it getting too complicated. Moreover, it is also possible to combine two of the three parts to this design pattern, so if you have a simple component with not very much logic, you could consider combining the controller and model into one."

    "The observer pattern is mainly used in situations where a particular event should lead to some other functions being triggered. The advantage of it is that you don't end up with a god class that \"knows\" which functions to call on which event cause this will everntually become very difficult to add additional functionality to. Instead the function should explicity subscribe to the events itself. This also fixes the alternative of having the subscribing functions constantly check if there are changes or needing to filter the events themselves.\n",
    "Lastly, this approach also allows for a more reactive or asynchronous approach that can be scaled to run the subscriber functions on multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some minor disadvantages though with the most prevalent being memory management in programming languages that don't utilise garbage collection. It can be hard to know what object owns the lifecycle of a subscriber and if they are unsubscribed, and then not used again, they could be lost and start causing memory leaks. Additionally, programmers should take care when implementing this design pattern as to not mutate information or introduce dependencies between subscribers as there is no guarenteed order and mutating data could lead to some hard-to-debug side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, if implemented responsibly this design pattern can be super effective as it decouples the source of data from how it is used, in an easy to understand way, and it allows you to keep adding subscribers without affecting the existing functionality."

    "The factory pattern is used when you want to leave the creation of an object up to class implementing the interface. This has the benefit of removing the coupling between the product and the creator, since it no longer needs to know which type of object to create. The alternative is to have a God class, instead of a creator class, that contains methods for all the different implementations for creating objects. By extracting these functions out into subclasses, which implement a common interface, you have introduced separation of concerns, that in turn allows you to add new implementations without affecting the code of the creator class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only a few minor downsides to this pattern, firstly that each implementation has to comply with a specific interface which should be easy to do with proper user of dependency injection. Secondly, for large projects, this could end up generating a lot of subclasses making it more difficult to traverse or understand but I believe that this is very minor as long as the file structure is appropriate and the interface has easy to follow method names."

    "The abstract factory pattern is similar to the factory pattern except it allows for a collection of related objects as well. This also shares the benefits of the factory method in that it simplifies your creator class since it only needs to interact with one interface and adding new implementations of this interface doesn't affect that. Additionally, it also ensures that objects created from the same factory are related and compatible with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the amount of extra classes you would be generating is worse compared to the factory method. If you had an interface with four methods that had been implemented by five other classes then adding a fifth method would require you to make changes to those five classes which in turn would require you to introduce five more object. Over time this number could get larger and larger leading to a very complicated file structure.\n",

Similarly to the factory patterns above, the alternative is to have a god class that just contains methods with each algorithm and then when it is called it will check the inputs (most likely with a switch or if..else statement) and delegate it to the correct method. By having all these algorithms implement a common interface you can easily switch out these objects and call the same method name with different outcomes.\n",

    "Moreover, the iterator pattern allows you to have multiple iterators for the same object since they are independent of each other (as long as you're not mutating the underlying colletion) and you can pause processing and continue at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting however, that this pattern can very easily be misused since most the time, for simple collections like arrays, it is cleaner to just loop over it like you would traditionally or for overly complex collections, it may be more recommended to just use its own methods rather than wrapping it in less efficient iterator."

    "## Dependency Injection Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dependency Injection Diagram](/Users/jhs16/Documents/Uni/uni-design-patterns/images/dependency-injection-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency injection is a creational design pattern with the intent to decouple the creation of dependencies from the parent, to help conform to programming principles such as SOLID's \"Single responsibility\". The main motivation behind this is that the alternatives to this lead to less cohesive code and make testing impossible or complicated, due to the need to potentially mock objects created within the class. An example alternative is using a factory that has a get method for generating objects, although this removes the responsibility of creating the object from the class, it still needs to know what to call on the factory, and mocking the response of this factory (so that we can control the object that is returned) could prove difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "As previously stated a few of the advantages are that it reduces coupling, increases cohesion and makes testing easier since mocked objects can passed directly into the constructor. Additionally, it can reduce the overall code since these components can be more easily reused and singletons don't need to be given special code to prevent multiple instantiations since instead the single instance is just passed around everywhere. One final advantage is that it can also have the added benefit of providing documentation on the dependencies for a component so that it is clear to the user what it is using.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "Similar to all patterns it does come with some potential disadvantages if not used responsibly. This design pattern is an implementation of the Inversion of Control pattern, which has the intent of redirecting the control of something to an external component or process. With dependency injection you are redirecting control of dependency creation, to the component calling the constructor, however, you do not want to have object creation scattered throughout your project and would need to implement a mechanism for and storing all object instances in one location. Fortunately, there are libraries out there to assist with this, an example for Java would be Spring.\n",
    "Another point is that your constructors could become very cumbersome if a component has a lot of dependencies, and it can then be hard to make these optional or default them. For external libraries this can lead to a much worse user experience as the user needs to understand every dependency the component uses and what to use as a default, even if they're only utilising a single part of the functionality. Luckily, this can also be solved with a different approach to dependency injection through the users of setters. Although this does introduce mutability into your component, the constructor would then only need to have the mandatory dependencies and can instatiate its own defaults, that would get overriden should the user need to use the set methods to change them. On the other hand, you could also overload the constructor to take different combinations of dependencies but programmers should be careful not to create too many as not to overcomplicate the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Below is an example implementation of a service which uses a database to get a list of users. There is also a handler which then uses this service to get information about a particular user. Both the service and handler both have a required dependency which is passed in using the two methods detailed above: constructor and setters."

    "## Reactor Design Pattern\n",

    "\n",
    "Diagram from Schmidt and Coplien, 1995 (page 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reactor design pattern is a concurrency design pattern with the intent of handling concurrent requests from one or more clients. All functionality should be given an event handler which implements a common interface such that when an event comes in, it can be dispatched to its corresponding event handler. The motivation for this design pattern is to avoid needing to manage multiple threads which can cause concurrency issues, usually fixed with locks or synchronising threads for specific functions. This design pattern instead has a singular event loop which takes in an event and execute it on an event handler. This event handler runs in the same thread but should not block it, so for example, if it sends a HTTP request it should free up that thread and once the response comes back, a new event is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to see the advantages of this pattern are to compare it to alternative solutions. Consider an API that takes in GET, ADD and DELETE requests which are forwarded to a database:\n",
    "- The non-reactor solution is to generate a new thread for each request that comes in, it needs to determine what type of request they have sent, then call the database and wait for its response, then return the database response to the user. Throughout this journey the application had to do a lot of work to determine how to handle the request, waste time by waiting for the databases response, and it involves the overhead of creating a new thread.\n",
    "- The reactor solution on the otherhand would receive the request and dispatch an event to the handler which is responsible for it. The handler would then process the request and send a call to the database where it would then release the thread. Once the response for the database comes back, it will go back through the event handler which would then dispatch a different event, this time to the handler which handles returning the response to the original caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the example above, the reactor pattern makes better use of resources by not managing multiple threads and not executing non-blocking calls but instead delegating that to a callback approach. Furthermore, this also introduces a separation of concern since each handler should only be executing non-blocking code, if you need to wait for a response, it should instead be handled by a second handler under a different event. This also improves upon the scalability of the application, since eight instances of a reactor application would be using the same amount of resources as a non-reactor application with eight threads, while being able to handle more requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in low level languages the managing of threads is in control of the programmer which leads to complicated, custom multithread implementations that can be hard to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Understandably, there are some potential problems that can arise from this pattern. Firstly, it should be noted that each even handler can only handle quick, non-blocking requests, so if you are developing an image server for storing images that users upload, the handler for handling the saving of these images, will probably take some considerable time depending on the size which would ultimately cause events to back up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the implementation of the handler is very important as developers need to make sure they are not accidentally introducing blocking code, and any exceptions thrown by the handlers need to be correctly handled otherwise it will bring down the entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, from a debugging point of view it is very difficult to follow the flow of data due to how events are processed in order of arrival and how instead of blocking it uses callbacks. If trying to \"step through\" the process, developers will find it difficult since it is not a simple case as going line by line but instead following the program through its complex infrastructure of reading the event and dispatching it to the correct handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a simplified Reactor implementation. Normally, there are a lot more components which make up a reactor application as it improves the readability and adheres to SOLID principles (like single responsibility) better."
